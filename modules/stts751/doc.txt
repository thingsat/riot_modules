# Driver for STTS751 Temperature Sensors

The driver is for the usage with [RIOT-OS](https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT).
It supports the [ST STTS751 temperature sensors](https://www.st.com/en/mems-and-sensors/stts751.html).

The STTS751 temperature sensor is available on the [X-NUCLEO-IKS01A3 eval board for Nucleo](https://www.st.com/en/ecosystems/x-nucleo-iks01a3.html])


## About the sensor

STTS751 is a digital temperature sensor that use an I2C interface.
The temperature is measured with a user-configurable resolution between 9 and 12 bits. At 9 bits, the smallest step size is 0.5 °C, and at 12 bits, it is 0.0625 °C. At the default resolution (10 bits, 0.25 °C/LSB), the conversion time is nominally 21 milliseconds.
Pull-up resistor value allows single pin to select one of four slave addresses.
