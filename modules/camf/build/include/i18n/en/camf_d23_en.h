Characteristics: Surface or crawling fires, crowns of trees are rarely affected, topsoil is burnt a little or not at all. Fire-fighting: Forest fire is ordinarily easy to extinguish. Behaviour: Do not carelessly discard cigarettes, tobacco products or lighters. Always watch barbecue fires and immediately extinguish stray sparks.", "", },

Characteristics: Intense surface fires can ignite the crowns of individual trees, spotting is possible, burning topsoil. Fire-fighting: Forest fire is difficult to extinguish and commands extensive resources. Behaviour: As a general rule, do not make any fires outdoors. Permanent fire places (concreted base) in locations designated by the authorities can be used with the utmost caution. Do not make fires in strong winds.", "", },

Characteristics: Very intense burning, extensive crown fires, long-distance spotting. Fire- fighting: Forest fire is virtually impossible to extinguish. Behaviour: Do not make any fires outdoors. Follow the instructions and observe the fire bans imposed by the local authorities.", "", },
