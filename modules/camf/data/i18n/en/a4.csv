On lakes, black ice is commonly overlain by white ice formed from refrozen snow or slush. (2) A popular alternative for glaze. A thin sheet of ice, relatively dark in appearance, may form when light rain or drizzle falls on a road surface that is at a temperature below 0°C or, alternatively, when water already on the road surface subsequently freezes when the temperature thereof falls below freezing point. It may also be formed when supercooled fog droplets are intercepted by buildings, fences and vegetation.

1010000;MET;Tropical cyclone (hurricane);A tropical cyclone originates over tropical or subtropical waters. It is characterised by a warm-core, non-frontal synoptic-scale cyclone with a low-pressure centre, spiral rain bands and strong winds. Depending on their location, tropical cyclones are referred to as hurricanes (Atlantic, Northeast Pacific), typhoons (Northwest Pacific), or cyclones (South Pacific and Indian Ocean). With a minimum wind speed of 119km/h (or 74 miles/h) a tropical storm in the Atlantic or Northeast Pacific is called a hurricane.
1010001;MET;Wind chill/frost;Frost is the consequence of radiative cooling resulting in the formation of thin ice crystals on the ground or other surfaces in the form of needles, feathers, scales, or fans. Frost occurs when the temperature of surfaces is below freezing and water vapor from humid air forms solid deposits on the cold surface. Freeze occurs when the air temperature is at (32˚F/0˚C) or below over a widespread area for a climatologically significant period of time. Use of the term is usually restricted to advective situations or to occasions when wind or other conditions prevent frost. Frost and freeze are particularly damaging during the crop growing season.
1010010;MET;Tropical cyclone (typhoon);A tropical cyclone originates over tropical or subtropical waters. It is characterised by a warm-core, non-frontal synoptic-scale cyclone with a low-pressure centre, spiral rain bands and strong winds. Depending on their location, tropical cyclones are referred to as hurricanes (Atlantic, Northeast Pacific), typhoons (Northwest Pacific), or cyclones (South Pacific and Indian Ocean). With a minimum wind speed of 119km/h (or 74 miles/h) a tropical storm in the Atlantic or Northeast Pacific is called a hurricane.
