000;Non-Threatening;Threat: No discernible threat to life and property.;Minimum Action: Listen for forecast changes. review tornado safety rules.;Potential Impact: None expected. strong wind gusts may still occur.
001;Very Low;Threat: A very low threat to life and property.;Minimum Action: Preparations should be made for a very low likelihood (or a 2 to 4% probability) of tornadoes. isolated tornadoes of F0 to F1 intensity possible.;Potential Impact: The potential for isolated locations to experience minor to moderate tornado damage.
010;Low;Threat: A low threat to life and property.;Minimum Action: Preparations should be made for a low likelihood (or a 5 to 14% probability) of tornadoes. scattered tornadoes of F0 to F1 intensity possible.;Potential Impact: The potential for scattered locations to experience minor to moderate tornado damage.
011;Moderate;Threat: A moderate threat to life and property.;Minimum Action: Preparations should be made for a moderate likelihood (or a 15 to 29% probability) of tornadoes. many tornadoes (even families) of F0 to F1 intensity possible.;Potential Impact: The potential for many locations to experience minor to moderate tornado damage (see below). Some tornadoes may have longer damage tracks.
100;High;Threat: A high threat to life and property.;Minimum Action: Preparations should be made for a high likelihood (or a 30 to 44% probability) of tornadoes. scattered tornadoes possible with isolated tornadoes of F2 to F5 intensity also possible.;Potential Impact: The potential for isolated locations to experience major tornado damage (see below), among scattered locations of minor to moderate tornado damage. Some tornadoes may have longer damage tracks.
101;Extreme;Threat: An extreme threat to life and property.;Minimum Action: Preparations should be made for a very high likelihood (or a 45% probability or greater) of tornadoes. many tornadoes (even families) possible with scattered tornadoes of F2 to F5 intensity also possible.;Potential Impact: The potential for scattered locations to experience major tornado damage (see below), among many locations of minor to moderate tornado damage. Some tornadoes may have longer damage tracks
