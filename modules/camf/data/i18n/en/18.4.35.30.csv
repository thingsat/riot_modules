0000;Unknown;
0001;Level 0/7;Deviation;No safety significance
0010;Level 1/7;Anomaly;Overexposure in excess of statutory annual limits. Minor problems with safety components with significant defence-in-depth remaining. Low activity lost or stolen radioactive source, device, or transport package.
0011;Level 2/7;Incident;Impact on people and environment: Exposure of the public in excess of 10 mSv. Exposure of workers in excess of the statutory annual limits. Impact on radiological barriers and control: Radiation levels in an operating area of more than 50 mSv/h. Significant contamination within the facility into an area not expected by design. Possible cause: Significant failures in safety provisions but with no actual consequences. Found highly radioactive sealed orphan source, device or transport package with safety provisions intact. Inadequate packaging of a highly radioactive sealed source.
0100;Level 3/7;Serious incident;Impact on people and environment: Exposure in excess of ten times the statutory annual limit for workers. Non-lethal deterministic health effect (e.g., burns) from radiation. Impact on radiological barriers and control: Exposure rates of more than 1 Sv/h in an operating area. Severe contamination in an area not expected by design, with a low probability of significant public exposure. Possible cause: Near-accident at a nuclear power plant with no safety provisions remaining. Lost or stolen highly radioactive sealed source. Misdelivered highly radioactive sealed source without adequate procedures in place to handle it.
0101;Level 4/7;Accident with local consequences;Impact on people and environment: Minor release of radioactive material unlikely to result in implementation of planned countermeasures other than local food controls. Impact on radiological barriers and control: Release of significant quantities of radioactive material within an installation with a high probability of significant public exposure.
0110;Level 5/7;Accident with wider consequences;Impact on people and environment: Limited release of radioactive material likely to require implementation of some planned countermeasures. Major health impact from radiation is likely. Impact on radiological barriers and control: Severe damage to reactor core. Release of large quantities of radioactive material within an installation with a high probability of significant public exposure. This could arise from a major criticality accident or fire.
0111;Level 6/7;Serious accident;Impact on people and environment: Significant release of radioactive material likely to require implementation of planned countermeasures.
1000;Level 7/7;Major accident;Impact on people and environment: Major release of radioactive material with widespread health and environmental effects requiring implementation of planned and extended countermeasures.
