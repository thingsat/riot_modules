Continuous exposure to these may cause, at the very least, a series of inflammatory reactions throughout the body.
10;Blood and blood products;While blood isn’t considered a biological hazard, it can still bring potential risks if it’s contaminated or its source is in any way infected. Also, blood products such as red blood cells, white blood cells, plasma, tissues, and platelets are also hazardous if not properly handled.
11;Environmental specimens;Generally, these refer to plants, soil, or water that potentially contain biological agents (include bacteria, viruses, parasites, and fungi) and biotoxins.
